# gentlewake
This android app synchronizes your alarm clock with your [Philips Hue system](http://www2.meethue.com) to wake you gently ;-)

The app is currently in closed-beta. If you're willing to live with some quirks and limitations, drop me a line by email (github-user @ google's mail service).
